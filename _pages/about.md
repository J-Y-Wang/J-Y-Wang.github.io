I graduated from [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](http://iao.nuaa.edu.cn), [College of Aerospace Engineering (CAE)](http://aero.nuaa.edu.cn) with B.S. in Aircraft Design and Engineering (2011) and M.S. in Aerospace Science and Technology (Helicopter) (2014).

I worked for 3 years as research assistant in [Professor Qijun Zhao's](http://hti.nuaa.edu.cn/2017/0612/c1343a44483/page.htm) Rotorcraft Computational Fluid Dynamics Lab of [Helicopter Technology Institute](http://hti.nuaa.edu.cn) on CFD/CSD coupling method with application to flexible helicopter rotors.

I then worked for 5 years in [China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC)](http://www.catic.cn), mainly about helicopters, UAVs, unmanned helicopters, torpedo, mission equipment's R&D, integration, test, marketing and production management.

I am now applying to the 19 fall Ph.D. programs in Aerospace Engineering in U.S. and Canada.
