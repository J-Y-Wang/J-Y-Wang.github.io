Abstract
--------
Based on effectiveness evaluation of conventional helicopters, a modified effectiveness analysis method for reconnaissance/strike unmanned helicopter is provided along with an analysis model considering characteristics of unmanned helicopter. This model includes effectiveness factors of helicopter as well as payload and application features of unmanned helicopter. The air-to-ground reconnaissance/strike effectiveness of S-100, VSR700 and MQ-8B unmanned helicopters are analyzed based on this model. Several influence factors of effectiveness are also analyzed.
