## Java Tutorial

**[w3schools Java tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java)**

*This part is only for quick grammar notes, but does not explain concepts and definition very clearly.*

At the beginning of learning Java, in comparison with C++ and Fortran, here are some quick notes.

C++ is part C and part Object Oriented, but Java is more Object Oriented from the very beginning, let's see.

Java use `class` and default main sentence `public static void main(String[] args)` rather than the `#include` and `void main` in C++.

<del>The definition of variable is slightly different, must using `int number=100` where in C++ and Fortran, there is no requirement for initial value.</del> This works only for local variables.

Java array looks a little bit more flexible compare to the scientific array in Fortran.

A `method` in Java is like a `suroutine` in Fortran or a `function` in C++.

Well, big head come with the Java Class.

`final` as a modifier like `constant` in Fortran.
